WARNING: Still need to be tested --> In Progress code

new commented version
- stuff "repaired" with gain tuning
- sinus fitting for the phase replaced by a simple smoothing (sliding average + interpolation)

4 improvements to bring:
- use the local minima of the Yfocusmeasure to give order
- detect if the object is in focus by counting the peaks
- override the gain(gain=1) when in focus
- fit a spline and substract it to the focus measure mesure to get a better resolution on the peaks (no more maximal speed)
